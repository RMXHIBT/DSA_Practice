/* Coding Problem
Problem Statement: Reverse LL (Iterative)
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
Given a linked list, reverse it iteratively.
You don't need to print the elements, just reverse the LL duplicates and return the head of updated LL.
`Input format : Linked list elements (separated by space and terminated by -1)``

Sample Input 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 -1

Sample Output 1 :
5 4 3 2 1
